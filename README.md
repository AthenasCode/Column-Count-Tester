# Column-Count Tester

I was having some issues getting CSS's column-count property to behave as expected on an iPad. This project is a result of my process of debugging the issue. 

See a more detailed explanation [on my website](https://emmamoore.vercel.app/posts/column-count-troubleshooting) or in the explanation on the [page itself](https://athenascode.github.io/Column-Count-Tester/).
