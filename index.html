        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          On iPhones and iPads, CSS's column-count property seems to behave
          differently. Users on other devices are unlikely to see a difference
          between the below columns. However, if you are viewing this on an
          iPhone or iPad*, you may see that the first two sections have
          misaligned columns. This seems to be a result of the margin of the
          bottom item of the first column separating from its block and shifting
          to the top of the second column.
          <br /><br />
          If you go back far enough, this happens on other devices. On Chrome 56
          (2017) on Windows 11, the same thing happens. It looks like they fixed
          that in 57. On Chrome 40 (2014), the blocks don't display at all. But
          on an iPad Pro 12.9 (2022), the misalignment occurs on both Safari and
          Chrome. If you keep testing on older devices and browsers, you might
          see other problems such as the blocks themselves breaking over the
          column. Here are a couple of writeups from several years ago that
          explain this behaviour in more detail:
        </p>

          *Note that this behaviour does not show up if you use DevTools to view
          the page on an iPad or iPhone. You can use a site like
          <a href="https://live.browserstack.com">BrowserStack</a> or
          <a href="https://www.lambdatest.com/">LambdaTest</a> to test this
          yourself.

        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>Each column-section has a column-count: 2.</p>
        <p>
          Each block has the following styles: <br /><br />
          .block { <br />border: 1px solid black;<br />
          width: 100%;<br />
          box-sizing: border-box;<br />
          margin-bottom: 10px;<br />
          break-inside: avoid-column;<br />
          }
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, the block "display" property has been set as indicated below.
        </p>
        <h3>"Block" vs "inline-block"</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Block</strong> starts on a new line and extends to the full
            width of its container, pushing subsequent elements to a new line.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Inline-block</strong> allows elements to sit next to each
            other horizontally, like inline elements, but you can still set
            width, height, and vertical margins like block elements.
          </li>
        </ul>
